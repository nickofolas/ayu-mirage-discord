# Ayu Mirage Discord

A Discord theme using the popular Ayu Mirage color palette.

# Usage

By default, this theme modifies Discord's colors and rearranges its layout some. It also includes some additional optional modifications, which are not enabled by default. These options can be enabled by un-commenting the respective lines in the [`import.css`](https://github.com/nickofolas/ayu-mirage-discord/blob/master/import.css) file. (You may need to reload the theme/reload your client to apply the changes)

# Installation
